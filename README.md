=====================

The original code (Code_old.gs) was modified from the following discussion on Stack Overflow:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59336498/send-a-message-to-discord-channels-via-google-apps-script

With minor modifications to allow sending stored string from sheet and adding a button for sending it.

You only need two information:
